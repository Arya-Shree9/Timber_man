# 🌲 Timberman Game – SFML C++ Version

A fun, fast-paced Timberman-style arcade game developed using **C++ and SFML**. In this game, the player chops a tree while avoiding falling branches. It's a great beginner-friendly project to learn game loops, sprite manipulation, animations, and real-time input handling using the SFML library.
